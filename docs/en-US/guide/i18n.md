# Internationalization

Vue EP Toolkit components use English **by default**. If you want to use other
languages, read on to find out how.

## Global configuration

Element Plus provides global configuration options.

```ts [main.ts]
import VueEpToolkit, { zhCn } from "vue-ep-toolkit"

app.use(VueEpToolkit, {
  locale: zhCn
})
```

## Date and time localization

We use [Day.js](https://day.js.org/docs/en/i18n/i18n) library to manage date and time in components like `DatePicker`. It is important to set a proper locale in Day.js to make internationalization work properly. You have to import Day.js's locale config separately.

```ts
import "dayjs/locale/zh-cn"
```

[Supported Language List](https://github.com/element-plus/element-plus/tree/dev/packages/locale/lang)

<ul class="language-list">
  <li>Simplified Chinese (zh-cn)</li>

If you need any other languages, [PR](https://github.com/element-plus/element-plus/pulls)
is always welcome, you only need to add a language file [here](https://github.com/element-plus/element-plus/tree/dev/packages/locale/lang).

  .language-list {
